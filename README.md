# Banking-Data-Analysis-in-SQL
Introduction:

Welcome to my SQL banking data analysis project! This project delves into a comprehensive dataset comprising Customers, Accounts, Transactions, and Branches tables. By leveraging SQL queries, I sought to uncover valuable insights and answer specific questions that can help a bank enhance its services, detect potential fraud, and optimize operations.

In this project, I used the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method to structure my approach and findings. The analysis addresses ten critical insights, ranging from identifying inactive customers to calculating average balances and ranking branch performance. The detailed explanation of each step, along with the SQL queries used, provides a clear and actionable understanding of the banking data.

Feel free to explore the insights and findings, and I hope you find this analysis both informative and useful!
