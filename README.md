# Banking-Data-Analysis-in-SQL
**Introduction:**

Welcome to my SQL banking data analysis project! This project delves into a comprehensive dataset comprising Customers, Accounts, Transactions, and Branches tables. By leveraging SQL queries, I sought to uncover valuable insights and answer specific questions that can help a bank enhance its services, detect potential fraud, and optimize operations.

In this project, I used the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method to structure my approach and findings. The analysis addresses ten critical insights, ranging from identifying inactive customers to calculating average balances and ranking branch performance. The detailed explanation of each step, along with the SQL queries used, provides a clear and actionable understanding of the banking data.

Feel free to explore the insights and findings, and I hope you find this analysis both informative and useful!


**Situation:**

In a banking environment, it's crucial to understand customer behaviors, transaction patterns, and overall financial health. I was tasked with analyzing banking data to derive actionable insights. The dataset included several tables: Customers, Accounts, Transactions, and Branches, with relationships established between them. The goal was to answer specific questions that would help the bank improve its services and operations.

**Task:**

1.The objective was to analyze the banking data to answer the following ten questions:

2.Identify customers who haven't made transactions in the last year and suggest strategies to re-engage them.

3.Summarize the total transaction amount per account per month.

4.Rank branches based on the total deposits made in the last quarter.

5.Find the customer who deposited the highest amount.

6.Detect accounts with more than two transactions in a single day, which may indicate fraudulent activity, and propose verification methods.

7.Calculate the average number of transactions per customer per account per month over the last year.

8.Determine the daily transaction volume for the past month.

9.Calculate the total transaction amount performed by each age group in the past year.

10.Find the branch with the highest average account balance.

11.Calculate the average balance per customer at the end of each month over the past year.
